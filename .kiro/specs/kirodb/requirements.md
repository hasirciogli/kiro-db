# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KiroDB is an offline-first, desktop SQL management application built with Electron and React. The application provides a secure, multi-database compatible interface for database schema exploration, query execution, and result visualization. The initial version (v0) focuses on PostgreSQL support with a clean, intuitive interface that prioritizes performance and security. Version 0.2 will extend support to MySQL/MariaDB.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connection Management

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want to manage multiple database connection profiles securely, so that I can quickly switch between different databases without re-entering credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new connection profile THEN the system SHALL store connection metadata (name, dialect, host, port, user, database, ssl settings) in local config file
2. WHEN I save a connection profile with password THEN the system SHALL store the password securely in OS keychain using keytar
3. WHEN I select a connection profile THEN the system SHALL establish connection using stored credentials without exposing password to renderer process
4. WHEN I edit an existing profile THEN the system SHALL update metadata and optionally update keychain password
5. WHEN I delete a profile THEN the system SHALL remove both config metadata and keychain password
6. IF connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error message with connection details

### Requirement 2: PostgreSQL Database Support (v0)

**User Story:** As a PostgreSQL user, I want to connect to PostgreSQL databases and execute queries, so that I can manage my database operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect to PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL use pg and pg-cursor libraries for database operations
2. WHEN I execute a SELECT query THEN the system SHALL return columns, rows, rowCount, and command information
3. WHEN I run a long query THEN the system SHALL support cancellation using pg_cancel_backend with separate client connection
4. WHEN I stream large result sets THEN the system SHALL optionally support chunked data retrieval using pg-cursor
5. IF query execution fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information
6. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL capture and store backend process ID for cancellation support

### Requirement 3: Schema Explorer

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to browse database schemas, tables, and columns in a hierarchical view, so that I can understand database structure and quickly generate queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect to a database THEN the system SHALL list all non-system schemas
2. WHEN I expand a schema THEN the system SHALL display all tables within that schema
3. WHEN I expand a table THEN the system SHALL show column information including name, type, nullable status, and default values
4. WHEN I click on a table THEN the system SHALL auto-insert "SELECT * FROM schema.table LIMIT 100;" into the query editor
5. WHEN schema loading fails THEN the system SHALL display error message while keeping other functionality available
6. WHEN I refresh schema THEN the system SHALL reload current schema structure from database

### Requirement 4: SQL Query Editor

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want a powerful SQL editor with syntax highlighting and keyboard shortcuts, so that I can write and execute queries efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the query editor THEN the system SHALL provide Monaco editor with SQL syntax highlighting
2. WHEN I press Ctrl/Cmd+Enter THEN the system SHALL execute the current query
3. WHEN I write SELECT queries THEN the system SHALL automatically apply LIMIT 1000 if no LIMIT is specified
4. WHEN I specify a custom LIMIT THEN the system SHALL respect my specified limit
5. WHEN I execute a query THEN the system SHALL display execution time and row count
6. WHEN query is running THEN the system SHALL show loading indicator and enable cancel button
7. IF query contains syntax errors THEN the system SHALL display error details with line information

### Requirement 5: Result Data Grid

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to view query results in a performant, interactive grid, so that I can analyze data effectively with sorting and filtering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query returns results THEN the system SHALL display data in AG Grid with virtualization for performance
2. WHEN I click column headers THEN the system SHALL enable sorting by that column
3. WHEN I use column filters THEN the system SHALL filter displayed rows based on criteria
4. WHEN result set is large THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance through virtualization
5. WHEN I switch between queries THEN the system SHALL preserve grid state per query tab
6. WHEN query returns no results THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state message
7. WHEN I select rows THEN the system SHALL highlight selected rows for export operations

### Requirement 6: Data Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export query results to CSV and JSON formats, so that I can use the data in external tools and reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click export button THEN the system SHALL offer CSV and JSON format options
2. WHEN I select CSV export THEN the system SHALL export currently visible/selected grid data as CSV file
3. WHEN I select JSON export THEN the system SHALL export currently visible/selected grid data as JSON array
4. WHEN no rows are selected THEN the system SHALL export all visible rows
5. WHEN rows are selected THEN the system SHALL export only selected rows
6. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL show success notification with file location
7. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display error message with failure reason

### Requirement 7: Query History Management

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to access my recent query history, so that I can quickly re-run or modify previous queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a query THEN the system SHALL save query text to history for current connection profile
2. WHEN I view query history THEN the system SHALL display last 50 queries per connection profile
3. WHEN I select a historical query THEN the system SHALL load query text into editor
4. WHEN I switch connection profiles THEN the system SHALL show history specific to selected profile
5. WHEN I clear history THEN the system SHALL remove all stored queries for current profile
6. WHEN application restarts THEN the system SHALL persist and restore query history

### Requirement 8: Application Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to follow security best practices, so that my database credentials and queries remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application initializes THEN the system SHALL set contextIsolation: true and nodeIntegration: false
2. WHEN renderer needs database operations THEN the system SHALL only access functionality through contextBridge preload API
3. WHEN storing passwords THEN the system SHALL never expose passwords to renderer process
4. WHEN handling database connections THEN the system SHALL manage all database drivers only in main process
5. WHEN IPC communication occurs THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data transfers
6. WHEN application updates THEN the system SHALL maintain security boundaries between processes

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user working with large datasets, I want the application to remain responsive, so that I can work efficiently without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying large result sets THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to maintain UI responsiveness
2. WHEN applying default LIMIT THEN the system SHALL limit result sets to 1000 rows unless user specifies otherwise

4. WHEN streaming is available THEN the system SHALL optionally support chunked data loading for very large queries
5. WHEN multiple queries run THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without blocking UI
